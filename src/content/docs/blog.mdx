    href="exhaustiveness-checks-in-typescript/"
    description="<img src='/blog/exhaustiveness-checks-in-typescript.jpg'></img><br>Exhaustiveness checks make sure that there is a suitable if/else or switch/case branch for every possible input that a function might process. Without these safeguards, unexpected input can lead to silent failures that are hard to spot. In TypeScript, exhaustiveness can be checked through the type system to identify missing code paths right at compile-time."
